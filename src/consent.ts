    <h1>Informed Consent</h1>
    <p>Title of Study: ADHD and Visual Attention</p>
    <p>Investigators: Sui Par; Deborah Cronin</p>
    <p>
      This is a research study. Please take your time in deciding if you would
      like to participate.
    </p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The purpose of this study is to improve our understanding of Attention
      Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) as the impacts that ADHD has on the
      ability for individuals to understand and explore visual information and
      how the visual information we are exposed to influences our ability to
      learn to learn about the visual scenes that we are exposed to.
    </p>

    <p>
      You should not participate if you are not over the age of 18, you do not
      have normal or corrected-to-normal (i.e., 20/20 or better) vision, or if
      you are colorblind.
    </p>

    <h2>Procedures</h2>
    <p>
      If you agree to participate, you will take a short (5-10 minutes)
      questionnaire, assessing the prevalence (or lack thereof) of ADHD
      symptoms. This questionnaire will contain questions regarding attitudes,
      behaviors, and feelings towards others that you have exhibited earlier in
      life. Then a series of instructions will be displayed describing a short
      experiment you will complete. In this experiment, you will see a series of
      screens showing letters in different orientations. You will respond to one
      of the letters on each screen using your keyboard. The experiment will
      last approximately 20 minutes. Your entire participation should not take
      longer than 30 minutes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your data will be stored on a password-protected database and
      password-proetected computer. Your stored ADHD questionnaire data will
      contain information about certain behaviors that you experienced earlier
      in life. Your stored visual attention data will include the time that it
      took you to identify a target object across many trials.
    </p>

    <h2>Risks</h2>
    <p>
      There are no foreseeable risks at this time from participating in this
      study. If you are negatively impacted at any time during or after this
      study, please contact Prof. Deborah Cronin at 515-271-2043 or
      Deborah.cronin@drake.edu, and Drake University IRB at irb@drake.edu or
      515-271-3472. If you are experiencing an emergency, call 9-1-1.
    </p>

    <h2>Benefits</h2>
    <p>
      If you decide to participate in this study there will be no direct benefit
      to you. It is hoped that the information gained in this study will benefit
      society by increasing our understanding of how ADHD symptoms impact
      someone's visual cognition.
    </p>

    <h2>Compensation</h2>
    <p>
      If you participate, you will automatically receive compensation through
      Prolific at a rate of USD $12/hour.
    </p>

    <h2>Participant Rights</h2>
    <p>
      Your participation in this study is completely voluntary and you may
      refuse to participate or leave the study at any time. If you decide to not
      participate in the study or leave the study early, it will not result in
      any penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.
    </p>

    <h2>Confidentiality</h2>
    <p>
      Any information obtained in connection with this research study that can
      be identified with you will be disclosed only with your permission; your
      results will be kept confidential. In any written reports or publications,
      no one will be identified or identifiable and only group data will be
      presented. However, federal government regulatory agencies, auditing
      departments of Drake University, and the Institutional Review Board (a
      committee that reviews and approves human subject research studies) may
      inspect and/or copy your records for quality assurance and data analysis.
      These records may contain private information. To ensure confidentiality
      to the extent permitted by law, the following measures will be taken: you
      will be assigned a subject number that uniquely identifies your data in
      this experiment. This subject number will be matched with your demographic
      data and time of experiment participation on Prolific, separate from all
      other data collected during this experiment. Your experimental data will
      not be stored with any personal identifiers: all files will be named using
      the subject number assigned to you. All data will be stored on a
      password-protected database and password-protected computer and will only
      be accessed by student and faculty researchers affiliated with this study.
      Experimental data will be kept indefinitely.
